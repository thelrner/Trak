Changed: landing_page.js
user_creation.js
user_creation.jst.ejs
landing_page.jst.ejs

BUGS
Fix team index message - it doesn't always display

Extend modal display into global function extended into each View

Make a tooltip top-level style that displays it on hover of anything with id=whatever and class tooltip
Maybe can make a tooltip partial that just takes a "content" input?
