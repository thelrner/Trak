RED ERROR HIGHLIGHTING ON FORMS

Changed: landing_page.js
user_creation.js
user_creation.jst.ejs
landing_page.jst.ejs

extract modal_hook
div: modal
div: modal-cover

make displaying modal a global function! You do this everywhere now -- user creation, team creation, editing, etc.

Make a tooltip top-level style that displays it on hover of anything with id=whatever and class tooltip
Maybe can make a tooltip partial that just takes a "content" input?
